Penobscot Community Health Care, a Federally-Qualified Health Center based in Bangor, Maine, celebrated their 20th year in 2018.

To celebrate, we developed a logo and associated marketing campaign to show patients where we've been and where we were going.

I also developed a campaign site at PCHC20.com to show some of PCHCs accomplishments over the years. An archived version of this site can now be found at <https://pchc20.now.sh>
